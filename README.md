# r_course_english
The this repository contains the english version of my r course, last updated: 2011. It is incomplete still, but will be completed when possible.

Please keep in mind that it is a rough translation from the German course material, and some of the variable names resulted from the contribution of the (german) students, so they do not follow in all cases the regularities that one would request for good R code.

If you can accept that, enjoy.
